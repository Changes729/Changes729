> - A **social issue** is a problem that affects many people within a society. It is a group of common problems in present-day society that many people strive to solve. It is often the consequence of factors extending beyond an individual's control. Social issues are the source of conflicting opinions on the grounds of what is perceived as morally correct or incorrect [personal life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life) or interpersonal social life decisions.

> - Exemplary for social issues was the so-called [social question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_question) in the beginning of the [industrial revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution). Growing poverty on one and growing population and [materialistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism) [wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth) on the other hand caused tension between very rich and poorest people inside society.

> - In *Rights of Man and Common Sense*, Thomas Paine addresses the individual's duty to "**allow the same rights to others as we allow ourselves.**" The failure to do so causes the creation of a social issue.

> - A **[valence issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_issue)** is a social problem that people uniformly interpret the same way.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issue#cite_note-3) An example of a valence issue is child abuse, which is condemned across several societies. **A position issue** is a social problem in which the popular opinion among society is divided.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issue#cite_note-books.google_a-4) Different people may hold different and strongly-held views, which are not easily changed. An example of a position issue is [abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion) which, in some countries, has not generated a widespread consensus from the public.
