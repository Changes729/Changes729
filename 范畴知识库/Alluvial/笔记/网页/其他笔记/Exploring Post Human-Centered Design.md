## 摘记

The previous mentality of being able to draw clear dividing lines must be discarded. The networking and branching of human and nature, user and computer, object and interaction, demands an attitude, **which considers connections instead of individual parts. An attitude that focuses on relationships and context, not only on the user or human.**

This attitude could be called Post Human-Centered Design, or **more-than-human Design**. While there are slight differences in their definition and focus, they share their most basic task: **To find a way to grow above the Human-Centered and find a way to include those actors that are forgotten.**

**ANT is concerned with the relationships and interrelationships between human and non-human actors.** Non-human actors in this case are **not only animals and living beings**, but also objects and abstract constructs. This fundamentally different approach of looking at the world makes it a valuable research tool for design. Instead of trying to place technological objects into the life of the user and fitting them to their need, it suggests to take a deeper look at the new user-object actor (Latour, 1999). **Are there new relationships that are formed? Are there old relationships that are changed in the process of user and object becoming one?**

In recent years, more voices have raised the issue of promoting the described switch. Some are writing about **society centered approaches** (societycentered.design, 2020) or **fluid assemblages** (Reström & Wiltse, 2018), others are talking about knotty objects (Oxman, 2016) and designing in a medium (Easterling, 2020). Again, **they share a common thought process: Technology is entangled in our lives; it forces us to deal with the new life-forms that are going beyond the human individual.**

One approach of Post Human-Centered Design is the democratization of, but also by means of design. **Human and non-human actors who are disadvantaged by designed systems should be given a voice**. What was still reserved for the user in the Human-Centered, should also affect other co-actors in the Post Human-Centered. The first step of democratization would be to include (non-human) stakeholders in the design process (cf. Rod, 2009, Haraway, 2016). When designing for example in an urban system like a city, non-human stakeholders could be animals that live in that ecosystem like pigeons, but also social communities.
