# Vector DAO

> In the age of Wall Street Bets, tech IPOs, and token listings, t**he power of ownership in generating wealth is now well understood**. As a result, **more and more people are choosing to invest instead of build.** And we don’t blame them.
>
> **Investors have a rich ecosystem of legal structures and financial tools available to them.** They can use portfolios to make multiple bets simultaneously. They can protect those bets with financial innovations like pro rata terms, transfer rights, liquidation preferences, the list goes on.
>
> Meanwhile, **makers have to choose between betting all their time on one company**, or contracting for cash with no ownership upside.
>
> Something feels broken here. **There’s no reason top talent shouldn’t be able to diversify their bets, or invest their time in a portfolio of projects like investors do.**
>
> Vector DAO is a decentralized collective of designers, brand experts, and creatives pioneering **a new way of working that tilts the scales back towards builders.**
>
> We’ve built **new org structures** that make it seamless for **contributors to earn equity and tokens for their work.** Being compensated in illiquid tokens can be risky so **we protect our members by distributing the risks and upside of any one project by pooling these tokens into a portfolio shared by all our members.**

> three main challenges:
>
> **Ownership, not cash**：*Wealth is generated not through selling time, but by owning assets with asymmetric payoff.*
>
> Vector DAO only accepts **equity or tokens** as compensation **in exchange for services provided**.
>
> **Diversification**：*Today, **acquiring ownership** through work **means betting years of your life on a single startup in the hopes it becomes a unicorn**. Meanwhile, investors can build portfolios to diversify risk and increase exposure to multiple successful companies.*
>
> Vector DAO provides members exposure **to a diversified portfolio of projects through its seasons model.** You can think of a Vector DAO season like a venture fund (e.g. fund 1, fund 2 etc). **Contributors to any deal within a season will own “carry” in the entire season’s portfolio proportional to their contribution as well as feedback from their season’s peers **(inspired by [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/)). This allows a contributor to scale their time to earn ownership in a diversified portfolio of projects instead of just one.
>
> **Schedule flexibility**：*The idea of 9 to 5 employment is a relic from the industrial era. Knowledge workers are like athletes, meant to sprint and recover.*
>
> Members sign up for the level of commitment they deem best for themselves. **Vector DAO works with both full and part time contributors. <u>If members choose to take time off and skip a season</u>, that’s ok too.** Unlike traditional startups, there’s no cliff with Vector DAO.

> **How do Seasons work?**
>
> A Season is a portfolio of projects. **Each Season aims to have a target dollar value of tokens/equity in it at current project valuations.** Members who contribute to any project within a Season will earn a slice of every project in that Season. Members must continue contributing to new Seasons in order to earn ownership in those Seasons.

> Vector DAO是一个集合了设计师、艺术家和创意者的创意工作者投资型DAO。其成员有Leader和Contributor两种角色。Learder负责引入交易流程、人员配备和项目管理，并最终控制交付工作质量。其除了需要Contributor所具有的设计技能外，还需要创业和领导技能，并积极参与构建Vector DAO。在Vector DAO的每个Session中，通过参与或投资一些项目，相关成员获得对应项目的股权 或Token作为回报。其目的是让创作者也能参与投资独角兽。

这个组织模式还是非常有意思的，但是资料有点少，可以作为后续研究对象之一。
