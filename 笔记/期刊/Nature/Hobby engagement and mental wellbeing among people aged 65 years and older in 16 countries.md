# Hobby engagement and mental wellbeing among people aged 65 years and older in 16 countries

## Abstract

Growing aging populations **pose** a threat to global health because of the social and psychological challenges they experience. To **mitigate** this, many countries **promote hobby engagement** to support and improve mental health. 

Yet, it remains unclear whether there is **consistency** in benefits across different national settings.

We harmonized measures of hobby engagement and multiple **aspects** of mental wellbeing across 16 nations represented in five longitudinal studies (*N* = 93,263).

**Prevalence** of hobby engagement varied substantially across countries, from 51.0% of Spanish respondents to 96.0% of Danish respondents. Fixed effects models and multinational meta-analyses were applied to compare the **longitudinal associations** between hobbies and mental wellbeing.

**Independent** of *confounders*, having a hobby was **associated** with fewer depressive symptoms (pooled *<u>coefficient</u>* = −0.10; 95% *<u>confidence intervals</u>* (CI) = −0.13, −0.07), and higher levels of self-reported health (pooled coefficient = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.03, 0.08), happiness (pooled coefficient = 0.09; 95% CI = 0.06, 0.13) and life satisfaction (pooled coefficient = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.12). Further analyses suggested a **temporal** relationship.

The strength of these associations, and prevalence of hobby engagement, were correlated with **macrolevel** factors such as life **expectancy** and national happiness levels, but overall, *little variance in findings was explained by country-level factors* (<9%). Given the relative universality of findings, ensuring equality in hobby engagement within and between countries should be a priority for promoting healthy aging.



## Main

Aging populations are an increasing global concern given the social and psychological challenges they can experience, including loneliness, social isolation and worsening mental health, all of which are associated with increasing physical **multimorbidity** and **mortality**[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02506-1#ref-CR1),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02506-1#ref-CR2).

Although **advancements** in healthcare have helped people live longer, healthy life **expectancy** (the average number of years that a person is expected to live with good health and without any disability, physical or psychological illnesses or injuries) is often not matched with the increase in life expectancy, and there is a growing prevalence of long-term mental health **conditions**. 

This is placing **untenable burdens** on global health and social care services, providing financial and workforce planning **predicaments**. 

There is increasingly global interest in how **engagement** in psychosocial activities could **address** these challenges. Hobbies (defined as activities that people engage in during their **leisure** time for pleasure, such as the arts, crafts, reading, playing games, sports, gardening, volunteering and participating in societies/clubs) involve **imagination**, **novelty**, creativity, **sensory** activation, self-expression, relaxation and **cognitive stimulation**, all of which are positively related to mental health and wellbeing via psychological, biological, social and behavioral pathways. 

These policies are **underpinned** by a large body of research that has shown how hobbies can enhance **multidimensional** aspects of mental health and wellbeing, including negative **symptomatology** and **clinical diagnoses** of depression and psychiatric conditions, **experiential** wellbeing (for example, positive and negative affect), **evaluative** wellbeing (for example, life satisfaction) and **eudemonic** wellbeing (for example, purpose in life) for older adults. 

Meta-analyses of both **observational** and **interventional** studies involving engagement in hobbies such as nature-based activities and volunteering have shown protective associations with **depressive symptoms**.

However, the **literature** *<u>to date</u>* is **hampered** by several limitations. 

Second, many studies have focused on specific subcategories of hobbies (for example, volunteering **versus** nature-based activities versus arts participation versus cultural engagement), often applying conflicting definitions. Yet all hobbies share common ‘active **ingredients**’ and activate similar **causal mechanisms** of action; it has been proposed that there is little to differentiate in their potential to affect population-level mental health outcomes.

This study was **therefore** designed to **harmonize measures** of hobby engagement and mental wellbeing in adults aged 65+ across 16 nations represented in five longitudinal studies, and explore the relationship with mental wellbeing, the direction of association and the variation in findings by country.

**Longitudinal associations between hobby engagement and mental wellbeing**

Fixed effects models tested the longitudinal associations of how changes in engagement in hobbies were associated with changes in mental wellbeing, **simultaneously** accounting for all time-constant factors (**regardless** of whether they were observed; for example, genetics, past leisure behaviors, medical histories and psychological traits) and identified time-varying factors (for example, sociodemographic backgrounds, clinical conditions and difficulties with activities of daily living). We then **pooled** our findings into **novel** multinational meta-analyses.

**Directionality**

Although fixed **effects regression** showed the nature of the relationship between hobby and mental wellbeing, the directionality of this relationship required further investigation. So we ran **ordinary least squares (OLS)** regressions estimating the associations between hobbies measured at Time 1 and the outcomes measured at Time 2, while controlling for identified **confounders** and baseline outcomes. Results were then pooled into meta-analyses.

We tested the **consistency** of these findings using a different **statistical approach**—*lagged fixed effects models* using an Arellano–Bond estimator model—on the ELSA dataset where there were **sufficient** repeated waves (nine available).

**Country-level factors**

To **ascertain** how much of the variance in the relationship with mental wellbeing was explained by country, we merged the datasets and ran multilevel models. After adjusting for **confounders**, associations between hobbies and the outcomes remained, and the country **variance** explained <9% of the total variance (Extended Data Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02506-1#Fig5)).
